# E2S.NginxPanel

## Objectives
To create a Nginx UI for native Windows Nginx Versions.

### Description
This solution is focused on attend to Nginx Windows version.

Nginx for Windows it's highly limited in comparison to Unix version and it's not recommended for production, but some 
environments are even more limited.
For these edge cases, this panel offers an alternative to similar solutions which needs more dependencies and 
configurations. The idea it's to display relevant data and offer limited control over Nginx instance.
As part of my portfolio, It will offer control only over .Net solutions.
